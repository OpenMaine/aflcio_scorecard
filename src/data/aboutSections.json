    "paragraph": "The 128th Maine Legislature was set in a period of staggering inequality, stagnant wages and declining living standards. As working people, we look for the Legislature to:\n\n- Reflect our core values of fairness, solidarity and economic justice;\n\n- Do everything within its power to support workers and their families;\n\n- And take proactive measures to create a just economy.\n\n\n\nThis legislative scorecard seeks to capture the votes that were of the greatest importance to working people in the second session of the 128th Maine Legislature (2018). It provides information on those bills and lets you know how your legislators voted.\n\nOur Legislative Committee and Executive Board carefully reviewed all the bills that came before the State Legislature and selected which bills to work on and to score. We hope you find the scorecard useful and that you will use it to hold your state legislators accountable."
